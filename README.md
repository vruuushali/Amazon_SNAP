# Amazon_SNAP
The Amazon SNAP Dataset has co-purchase dataset and product info. 
I have performed EDA on these datasets on Pyspark. 
Additionally, I've visualized the dataset on PowerBI.
I've also built 3 recommendation engines using jaccard similarity, networkx library and tiger graph and they can be used in postman API.
